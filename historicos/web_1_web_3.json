It's been some time since we spoke, but I wanted to check in and see how you're doing. Are you busy? Do you have anything on your mind that you want to share with me? Well, let's get started! Before we dive into the conversation, let's set a context for our conversation. You know, what we usually talk about in conversations on WhatsApp is pretty casual and short. We might have some gifs or emojis but not too much. Our conversations are typically quick, easy, and straightforward. I want to take this opportunity to ask you: how's life been for you? Are you having a great time? Is there anything that's causing you stress or frustration? Have you had any major life events recently like getting a promotion or deciding to move away from your hometown? I want to know so that we can have an open and honest conversation about whatever topic comes up. If you feel comfortable, let me know if you'd like to chat more in-depth about something specific. I also wanted to say hi and take this opportunity to share with you that I'm really enjoying my job lately. It's a small company where we make a difference in people's lives and I'm proud of what we've accomplished together. If you feel similarly, let me know and we can share our stories and experiences. In terms of context, I want to emphasize that these messages are casual and informal. It's okay if we don't get deep into all the details. Let's just chat about stuff that matters to us and make sure we stay connected. Before we end this conversation, let me know if there's anything else you'd like to talk about. I want to hear from you and make sure we have a good connection as friends and online acquaintances. I look forward to hearing from you soon! Let's chat more over the phone or video call anytime, shall we? Until then, take care and enjoy your day.",
